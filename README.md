# Week 0 Submission - Installation Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots and details of the successful installation of tools required for the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**.

## Tools Installed

The following tools were installed and verified in this setup:

- **Yosys**: A synthesis tool for Verilog, used for high-level hardware design.
- **Iverilog**: A Verilog simulation tool, used for simulating digital designs.
- **GTkwave**: A waveform viewer used for visualizing simulation outputs.
- **OpenSTA** (Optional): A Static Timing Analysis tool, used to analyze timing of digital designs.

## Installation Steps

The following steps were followed to install the tools:

1. **Git**: First, Git was installed to clone the necessary repositories.
2. **Yosys**: Cloned the Yosys repository and followed the build instructions to install it.
3. **Iverilog**: Installed Iverilog via package manager (`apt-get`).
4. **GTkwave**: Installed GTkwave via package manager (`apt-get`).
5. **OpenSTA** (Optional): OpenSTA was cloned from GitHub for Static Timing Analysis.

## Screenshots
