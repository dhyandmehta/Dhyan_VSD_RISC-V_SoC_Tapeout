# 🚀 My RISC-V SoC Tapeout Journey | VLSI System Design

Welcome to my **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** adventure! This repository chronicles my journey through each step of the program, from setting up the tools to working on advanced **System-on-Chip (SoC)** designs. As I progress, I’ll document my learnings, experiences, and challenges. Stay tuned for updates as I work towards mastering the world of **open-source SoC design**!

### 🌱 What is This Program?

The **RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program** aims to empower engineers and enthusiasts to design and implement their own System-on-Chip (SoC) using the **RISC-V** architecture. This collaborative initiative is part of **India’s largest RISC-V tapeout effort**, involving **3500+ participants**. Together, we’re building the future of silicon in India.

In this program, we will explore the following:
- **RTL design**: Writing and simulating hardware designs.
- **Synthesis**: Converting RTL to gate-level descriptions.
- **Verification**: Ensuring the designs work correctly.
- **Tapeout**: Preparing the design for silicon manufacturing.

## 🛠️ Week 0 - Environment Setup & Tool Installation

Week 0 was all about preparing the development environment. I successfully installed the essential **EDA tools** that will be used throughout the program. This includes **Yosys**, **Iverilog**, and **GTKWave**.

### 🔧 Tools Installed:

- **Yosys**: Open-source synthesis tool for Verilog designs.
- **Iverilog**: A simulator for Verilog HDL (Hardware Description Language).
- **GTKWave**: A waveform viewer to visualize simulation results.
