The .lib file in question is named sky130_fd_sc_hd_tt_025C_1v80.lib, which provides several key details about its contents and conditions.

Firstly, the "130" in the name suggests that this library is designed for a 130nm technology node. The segment "tt" refers to the "typical-typical" process corner — one of the standard process-voltage-temperature (PVT) corners used in digital design. The suffix "025C_1v80" indicates that the library characterizes cells at a temperature of 25°C and a supply voltage of 1.80V.

This library includes a standard cell set — such as basic logic gates — and provides multiple variants of each cell to support different design trade-offs. For example, there are several versions of the 2-input AND gate, labeled as and2_0, and2_1, and2_2, and so on. These versions differ in terms of drive strength, power consumption, speed, and area.

From our analysis, we observed that higher-drive versions of a gate (like and2_4) tend to be faster than their lower-drive counterparts (like and2_0). However, this improved performance comes at the cost of increased power consumption and larger silicon area. Designers can choose the appropriate variant based on the specific timing and power requirements of their circuit.
