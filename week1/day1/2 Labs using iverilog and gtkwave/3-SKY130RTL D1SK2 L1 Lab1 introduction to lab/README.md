# Setting Up the Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop

This guide walks you through the process of setting up the **Sky130 RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop** repository on your virtual Ubuntu machine.

## Step 1: Create a New Directory

First, navigate to your **home directory** and create a new directory where you will store the project files.

```bash
cd /home                  # Navigate to the home directory
mkdir VLSI              # Create a new directory for the workshop
cd VLSI     # Enter the new directory
````

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

Next, use **Git** to clone the repository from GitHub. This will download all the files and folders required for the workshop.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```

This command will create a copy of the `sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop` repository in your newly created directory.

## Step 3: Verify the Clone

After cloning, check that the repository has been successfully downloaded.

```bash
ls                    # List files in the current directory
```

You should see the `sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop` folder listed, confirming that the clone was successful.
