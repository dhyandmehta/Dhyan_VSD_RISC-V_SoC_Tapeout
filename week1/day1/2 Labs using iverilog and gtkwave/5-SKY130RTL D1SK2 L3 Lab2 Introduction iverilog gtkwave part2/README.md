# Understanding the `good_mux.v` and `tb_good_mux.v` Files

In this section, we explore the contents of the **`good_mux.v`** and **`tb_good_mux.v`** files to understand their structure and purpose.

## `good_mux.v`

The **`good_mux.v`** file defines the multiplexer module. The code is written in **behavioral Verilog**, which means it focuses on describing the functionality of the multiplexer rather than its specific hardware structure.

## `tb_good_mux.v`

The **`tb_good_mux.v`** file is the **testbench** for the multiplexer. It provides various input values and runs the simulation to verify that the **`good_mux.v`** module behaves as expected.

### Key Takeaways:

- **`good_mux.v`** is written in **behavioral Verilog** to describe the multiplexer’s functionality.
- **`tb_good_mux.v`** is a **testbench** used to verify the behavior of `good_mux.v`.

With these files, we can test the multiplexer’s logic and ensure it works as intended.
